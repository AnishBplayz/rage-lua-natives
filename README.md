# Official Sponsor :

[![PrivateHeberg](https://rageui.riveria.fr/ph.png)](https://privateheberg.com)
I would like to make an announcement about the official partners of my projects.

Today, I offer you the possibility to buy different virtual servers (VPS) LXC or KVM (Linux or Windows) via PrivateHeberg.net.

The perfect solution for the conception / realisation of your projects.

Let me point out that Privateheberg uses professional protection against DDOS attacks (VAC TILERA) in addition to the private protection provided by PrivateHeberg.

A discount code of 8% is valid on all products on the site for a period of 3 months. (valid for renewals) 

### PrivateHeberg is not a waste hosting company, it does not use a shitty technology like WHMCS or WorldPress. 

I personally recommend NvME products (LXC / KVM)

Discount code : <code>PACO</code> (-8%)
